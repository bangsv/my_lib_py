===

A football player scores a goal, according to him, in every 5th shot on goal. The coach's alternative hypothesis is one of 7 strikes. The verification volume of data is 100 beats.

- Calculate in the program code and output all ranges relevant to hypothesis testing.

- Write a function that checks the hypothesis based on the entered test data with a specified significance level equal to 5% by default.

- Write a function that calculates the verification power based on the given test data and the given value of the alternative hypothesis.

- Formulate your statistical hypothesis (not about athletes) and use your functions to test it.
