Tasks completed in the model:
---
- 1.1.1. Write, without using arithmetic operations, two or three lines of code,
giving the answer "yes" if the entered 10-digit natural number is divisible by 8.
- 1.1.2. Write a module to find the gcd of the number 8 and the given 10-digit
numbers, not using arithmetic operations, but using functions
user.
- 1.1.3. Complete the module from Exercise 1.1.2 by adding exceptions.
- 1.2.1. Create an arbitrary two-level list of integers, reals, and
complex numbers. Choose from it only complex numbers and write them down in
tuple.
- 1.2.2. Create a set of the first 100 elements of a sequence of partials
sums of the Fibonacci series. Print the number of significant digits of the element
sequences with a given
number.
- 1.3.1. Create a short script that finds all zeros of a given algebraic
functions on a given interval (float format variable).
- 1.3.2. Write a script to select from a given text all words beginning with
to "in", and sorting them alphabetically.
- 1.3.3. Download any article (for example, from Habr.ru) and form a string from it.
Count the frequencies for all the words contained in it.
- 1.4.1. Create a set of random natural numbers of size 10000
elements. Randomly sample 10 elements from it without replacement,
and then with a return without using the sample and choice methods. Fix the time
execution. Do the same using the specified module methods
random and compare execution speeds.
- 1.4.2. Using regular expressions, determine how many times, given
word formations, the Civil Code of the Russian Federation contains the word "law".
- 1.4.3. Create a Frac class whose typical instance is a common
shot. Describe the methods of inversion, addition, and multiplication.
