Approximation as a statistical hypothesis
=====

- From the Gismeteo Diary resource, take data on daytime temperatures in your home locality for January-April, 2020, 2021 or 2022 (at your choice). The average figures are weekly. Check the hypothesis that the temperature rise is described by an exponential function. The significance level is 5%.

- Do the same for a 4th order polynomial function.

- Calculate the check power for the best function compared to the worst.

- Separate the last four values from the sample and apply a polynomial approximation of the 7th order to the resulting sample. Calculate the p-value for the maximum deviation from the approximating function. Then calculate the same thing on the same function, but with a full sample. Compare and make a conclusion.
